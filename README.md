## Install Debian with btrfs in advanced expert install

Btrfs partition is a good way to use Linux cause it has many advanced features. Also it has good compression which reduces write cycles to your hard disks. And the most favorite thing i like about btrfs is its instant backup.
You can refer to this video on how to install debian with btrfs. By the way you can use a swap partition for convinience as me instead of zram. And i dont use btrfs-grub as Drew cause Debian break hardly you know ðŸ˜Š. And my subvolumes are @ @home @root @log @tmp:

## Install minimal Debian
First you can install a minimum install of Debian with only this option standard system utilities and also adding the non-free, contrib to the sources in advanced expert install:

or adding non free software to repo manually:

```bash
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm-updates main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

#deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
```

### This script also includes podman, support for bluetooth, vpn, battery percentage, slick-greeter instead of lightdm-gtk-greeter, etc. If you don't want any of them, you can nano the install script and delete unwanted packages.

## Quick install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhilHash/My-xfce-debian-install.git
cd My-xfce-debian-install
./install.sh
```
if you experience no network after install, it dues to the file in /etc/network/interfaces. Just comment out all the line inside that file and it will let network-manager configure the wifi. Any issues feel free to open at:
